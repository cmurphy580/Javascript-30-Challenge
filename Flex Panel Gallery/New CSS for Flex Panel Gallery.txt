New CSS for Flex Panel Gallery

- box-sizing: border-box
	- if the width and height are the same, but padding, content, or border size differs between the two then 'border-box' will make the two the same size. 'Border-box' does not consider margin.


-  *, *:before, *:after {
      box-sizing: inherit; -- 'inherit' - Inherits this property from its parent element.
    }
    - '*'  -- selects all elements and applies styles to them.
    - '*:before, *:after ' -- allows you to insert something :before and :after the selected elements.
    					   -- so in this case, all elements before and after the element would inherit box-sizing.
